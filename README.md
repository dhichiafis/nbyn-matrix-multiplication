# nbyn-matrix-multiplication
this is a simple n by n matrix multiplication solution
to solve an n by n matrix begin by solving the matrix by hand on a paper 
step two identify the data stracture that represents the matrix 
feed in the solutiion by hand this creates the illusion of you solving the problem from a computers perspective 
the iteration are brought about as you go through the the matrix as you would by hand 
the number of new list created is also visible as you go through the solution on the paper
